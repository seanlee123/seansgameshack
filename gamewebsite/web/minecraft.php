		<p>Minecraft is a sandbox game where the main object is survival, leveling up, and getting better... stuff. </p>
		<h1 id="titleheader"><strong>What's up with Minecraft</strong></h1>
		<p>So I have played quite a bit of this game and I just decided to make a blog about it.</p>
		<h3>There will be the play through on my minecraft video section. I will try to get an entry once to twice a week.</h3>
		<h2>Game 1 Barbarian: mc-hg.com</h2>
		<p>I got my first kill almost three minutes into the game. I got down to 3 life but got him. I found a cave and stupidly went into it after a group of two people and was able to take out one who had three iron and ran
		away from the other one. I went mining and found enough iron to make a iron hat. Deciding to tower over a pond I built a tower, but someone got to the top and knocked me off. He jumped into the pond after me. By this time
		my sword was ranked up to a high rank stone sword. I managed to get out of the pond and just hit him because he was under me. After that I killed some animals (I know animal abuse) to rank up my sword. It was near a 30 minute
		game but I was killed by  someone in the end he had a diamond sword while I only had a iron sword. I got 10 place out of 117 so not a horrible game but kinda boring.</p>
		<h2>Game 2 Cookiemonster: mc-hg.com</h2>
		<p>Well to start I towered over lava... you face palm, then I found that my tower ran into an over hang, you face punch, then someone dug down to me through
		the overhang. We both fell, but I landed on the ground... RIP sonic085 I then was able to eat 14 cookies because of lag. I then found iron and got a iron chest plate.
		When I was going back for more iron and I had seen it a creeper fell through a hole right on top of me. :,( I ended up with seventh place but a sad feeling of regret
		inside of me. <strong>Drama queen!</strong></p>
