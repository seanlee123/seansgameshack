    <h1>Borderlands 3?</h1>
	<p>I kinda’ feel like it is the back of everyone's mind. Maybe not up there with Titanfall and things like that, but... it's in there. Borderlands 2 was considered one of the most successful titles of 2012, and it seems preposterous for there not 
	to be a third. In our minds when there is a successful title, they make another, right. Well 2K games doesn't seem to feel the same way. In all interviews CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford has denied they are working on Borderlands 3. He posted on
	his twitter, <strong>“Clean and simple truth: the only Borderlands related game development work going on right now is for Borderlands 2./ it's fun to talk and think but actual effort is focused on Borderlands 2 DLC, Aliens, etc./ Chill out internet”. No one
	has started working on a sequel to Borderlands 2.</strong> :( It is the sad truth. Maybe in the future we will have our Borderlands 3, but in the meantime I have to go kill some Bad Ass Bullymongs and Pyros in plain old number two.</p>
	<h1>Blizzard is amazing!</h1>
	<p>Before I get started I just want to say that Blizzard makes by far some of the best games, But I'm not here to be a fanboy I'm here to talk about Diablo 3 and not any normal Diablo 3, Diablo 3 on the playstation 3 and the Xbox 360. This is the first game
	made by blizzard that came out on a console, and to say it did well would be an understatement. 3.3... MILLION copies sold within the first 24 hours is a pretty pig deal. The game looks great and the controls are very nice and smooth which has been a problem
	with many RPG's I have played. Diablo is in many regards better on a console, but I think if I'm really feeling Diablo I will still probably play it on the computer because from what I have seen so far it is a much more aggressive game on the PC, but
	for a beginner I would recommend the Console version. In terms of gameplay it is very much the same except as in most games the graphics look better on the PC. I am not trying to hate on the Console version because it is most likely just my bius keeping
	me away from it, but I still haven't beaten the game yet so when I do I'll be back with an update on Sean's Game Shack Diablo console.</p>
	<h1>Ps4, is anyone else excited.</h1>
	<p>Well I know I am. Me getting my hands on one the moment it comes out is going to be essential. I am by far the most excited about this console then any other console that has come out in my lifetime, and that amazing date is November 15 for America,
	November 29 for Europe. The games that I have seen for it look amazing and the Graphics card really ramps it up. Now it is a big argument going on right now about Xbox one VS PS4 and although I am a major Sony fan even I will say, if you look at the base 
	hardware going into both of the consoles, there is really no difference at all . Sorry both side are WRONG! I have seen half of the sites saying that the Xbox one is faster and the PS4 is faster and until we actually get our hands on one we really 
	can't decide. So lets just wait and then we can continue our fight once we know the truth, there I said it, but this is still about the PS4 so lets keep talking about it.</p>
